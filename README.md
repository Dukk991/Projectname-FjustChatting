# Projectname-FjustChatting

This is going to be a long term, "passion" project of mine. In twitch/streaming in general there is a small problem of large(ish) streamers watching youtube videos. What's the problem? The youtubers don't get views. They do get publicity, but I don't think that publicity translates to more views or subscribers. I'm goingto to attempt to solve this problem by creating an application that in a nutshell will share the streamers viewers. I will explain it in more detail shortly. I have a vaque view of how I'm going to achieve my goals. As I said, this will be a long term, multi year (maybe) project that is probably going to change down the line.

The plan:
* The streamer will somehow link their channel to the application (I don't know in great detail how twitch works, I'll figure it out)
* Before watching the video, the streamer will feed the url link of the video to the application
* The application will for the next 30 seconds of the video being played calculate the avg viewers
* Say, the avg view count for those 30 seconds was 4231 thousand viewers. The application will then create 4231 bots that will be send to watch the first 31 seconds of that youtube video
* When time is up, those bots will be killed

Problems:
* I yet know how to make the application read the streamers view count
* While making bots is easy, I don't know how recourse heavy creating possibly thousands of bots is
* Botting youtube videos isn't allowed. Nowadays there are two ads at the start of nearly every youtube video. That fucks with advertisers

Possible solutions:
* Figure it out
* Divide botting's in to multiple sections
* Reach out to youtube in hopes of developing a legitimate way to "bot"

That's it.
